This folder has scripts that can be used run time for admin only actions or to prepare some data.

#### `create-weapon-json.ts` & `create-gear-json.ts`

Before using this script you need to copy some files from another repository.

1. Copy all .json files from https://github.com/Leanny/leanny.github.io/tree/master/splat3/data/language to /scripts/dicts/langs
2. Move `WeaponInfoMain.json`, `GearInfoClothes.json`, `GearInfoShoes.json` & `GearInfoHead.json` from https://github.com/Leanny/leanny.github.io/blob/master/splat3/data/mush/099 to /scripts/dicts

(note: the path is likely to change to .../mush/latest in future)
