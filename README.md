## Running locally

Prerequisites: [Node.js 16.13](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
2. Make a copy of `.env.example` that's called `.env` and fill it with values.

- You can check [Prisma's guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database) on how to get PostgreSQL set up and running locally.
- Run `npm run seed` to seed the database with some test data.

3. Run `npm run dev` to run both the server and frontend.

## Seeding script variations

You can give a variation as a flag to the seeding script changing what exactly is put in the database. For example `npm run seed -- -v=check-in` seeds the database with a variation where check-in is in progress.
