# Rewrite plans

## TODOS

- [Â ] delete `app-old`

## Things that would be nice to improve

- More consistent repository pattern
- Easier to use admin panel
- Images more optimized (from Cloudflare?)
- Badges more optimized
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- Would retiring skalop service be possible?
- Better DB structure
  - Foreign keys + indexes missing sometimes
  - Consistent field naming e.g. always use "userId"
  - AUTOINCREMENT to make sure primary keys are not reused

## Libs we could utilize?

- Paraglide https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs
- daisyUI https://daisyui.com/
- Superforms https://superforms.rocks/
